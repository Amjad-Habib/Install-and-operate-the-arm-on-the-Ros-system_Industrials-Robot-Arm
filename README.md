# Install-and-operate-the-arm-on-the-Ros-system_Industrials-Robot-Arm
## This repository is about install and operate the robot arm on the Ros. Here is a simplified explanation:

* ### Robotic Arm 

I used (Ros Development studio) the constructsim website. First I uploaded the arm package on the (Code editor) page by right-clicking on a folder (src) which is inside a folder(simulation_ws) and choosing a new folder and inside the new folders I uploaded the files and then moved to a (Web shell) page and typed ($ cd simulation_ws/src/) and ($ roslaunch arm_pkg check_motors.launch) to run the package that you downloaded, then the arm can be displayed via the (Graphical tools) page.
